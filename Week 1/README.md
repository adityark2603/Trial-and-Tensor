# 🧩 Observation of Samples from Datasets
## 📌 Objectives

The primary goals of this repository are to:

* Learn how to load and explore standard datasets provided by `scikit-learn`
* Understand dataset structure, features, and targets
* Perform random sampling and train–test splits
* Analyze dataset statistics and distributions
* Build a strong foundation for future machine learning model development
